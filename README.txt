Name: Anthony Walujono, ID: 2328879, Project: Assign2

I have tried really hard to implement this assignment using class and objects.
I tried my best to figure out on my own how to use
function, classes, and objects, but my compilation has not been successful.
My unsuccessful code is placed on assign2.cpp. However, I have been successful
only on creating the format of the class on GenGrid.h.
I submitted my program that works and tested
for this assignment without classes nor objects on main.cpp.
Although I have been trying to reach out to Professor German and
the tutoring center for a week, I did not get the help I needed.
